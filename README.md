# Stellar-classification-project
I attempted to categorise stars in this project using the Kaggle data set.  The project proposal contains all of the goals, and the project report has all of the outcomes.The stellar classification project successfully identified highly accurate models for predicting star types
I also created a Web for this stellar classification project Using streamlit 
you can run the app.py file in vs code to get the output 
commands : pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib plotly seaborn scikit-learn numpy
           streamlit run app.py
